    <h1>Arabian Cuisine</h1>
    <h2>Some of my favorite Arab Cuisine and their descriptions are as follows:</h2>
    <h3>Khubz</h3>
    <p>This is the Arabic flatbread quite like the pita that you will find throughout the region, wherever you go. It is thick and traditionally baked in a tannur.</p>

    <h3>Kefta</h3>
	<p>The predecessor of the Indian kofta, the kefta is simply a grilled dish of ground meat like lamb or beef. It is mildly seasoned with paprika, parsley and sometimes onions and grilled like a seekh kebab.</p>

    <h3>Labneh</h3>
	<p>Yoghurt is perhaps as popular in the Arab world as in India. The labneh is a creamier version with the water drained out.</p>

    <h3>Qahwa</h3>
	<p>Qahwa is a traditional Arabic Coffee Recipe that is most popular Arabian cuisine. Qahwa is made from green coffee beans and cardamom. It is often served with dates.</p>
